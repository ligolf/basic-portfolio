                    <p> Hi.  My name is Gil.  I have recently gone through some major life changes.  I got Married again in Dec to my beautiful Wife, Loren.  We bought a great townhouse in Tarzana, CA. and I recently started my own business as a handyman which has been going very well.</p>
                
                  

                    <p>My younger son Chris who is 19 years old has recently moved in with my wife and I.  My older son Jordan was slotted to move in with us but to my dismay, he decided to move to Las Vegas with his mom.</p>
                
                    <p>I enjoy golfing on my free time and I really enjoy coding and fixing things.</p>
